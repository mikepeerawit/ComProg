This repository is for the assigments I did on Computer Programming course by professor Sirin Nitinawarat at Chulalongkorn Univerity.

Course Description:

This course aims at introducing first-year undergraduate engineering students with basic computer programming. The course assumes no prior knowledge about computer systems and any knowledge of computer programming. Important programming concepts required in most modern programming languages, including program design, data types, conditional and iterative control flows, creating and using subroutines (methods), and arrays, are covered in this course. Java programming language is chosen for introducing these concepts and demonstrations of real source code. The course also touches briefly upon some concepts related to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) including classes, objects, and inheritances. Solving problems using recursive approaches is also introduces in order to expand studentsâ€™ perspective beyond iterative approaches familiar with most novice programmers.
